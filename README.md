# Youtube Trending Channel Analysis  

### Project Overview
In this project, I have endeavored to showcase diverse Power BI skills through an in-depth analysis of trending YouTube channels. The dataset, acquired from the internet, comprises approximately 16 columns and 187,392 rows, providing a robust foundation for comprehensive exploration and visualization within the Power BI environment.

### Data Sources
The dataset is acquired from internet in excel format and contains data for 4 years from 2020 to 2023. 

### Data Model

The presented image illustrates the integrated data model for this project, featuring the inclusion of an additional "Calendar" table. A pivotal aspect of the model involves establishing a relationship between the date columns within the "Calendar" table and the primary "Actual Data" table. The incorporation of a dedicated "Calendar" table is indispensable for several reasons:
Date-based Aggregations, Consistent Date Hierarchies, Enhanced Filtering and Slicing.


### Findings
The image depicted below illustrates the layout of our primary page. I have strategically implemented interactive elements to sustain viewer engagement, ensuring a compelling user experience. This approach aims to seamlessly balance the allure of interactivity with the delivery of a comprehensive overview of the analysis, fostering sustained interest and understanding among the audience.
